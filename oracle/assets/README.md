# Link's Oracle Source Code

This folder contains a copy of the Link's Oracle website source code, painstakingly extracted via individual GET requests to the original domain where, as of Jan 2024, it is still, somehow, [being hosted](https://ganon4.tripod.com/oracle.html). I no longer have access to the hosting site (I neither remember nor have access to the original email or password), but back in these days there wasn't a "build stage", so the returned HTML when you visit the site is, more or less, the source code. I've made some light modifications (see below) but this is otherwise my best effort to make a copy of the original state.

- Removed Tripod-injected JavaScript ads
- Removed references to email addresses
- Redacted last names of individuals
