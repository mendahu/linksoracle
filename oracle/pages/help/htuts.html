    <summary>How to use??</summary>
    There's a lot to unpack here, LOL. I tend to think of user experience today
    in terms of "if you have to teach them how to use it, it's too complicated",
    so a page like this seems like a symptom, not a solution. But present me is
    so thankful that past me documented some of these technical problems!

  <p>This site was built under consideration of all browsers. However, Internet Explorer (4.0+)
  is by far the best browser.  Netscape is good, but it doesn't support the following:<br><br>
  <b>Style Sheets</b>- These I use in the Navbar.  When you pass your cursor over the link, it changes color.<br>
  <b>BackGround Music</b>- I use music throughout my site but the tag is only IE compatible.  I thinkyou might be able to use communicator to hear it though.<br><br>
  I recommend that you use IE 4.0+.  I actually use 5.0 on my 17 inch monitor.  My page looks
  best with one.  If you need a new browser, get IE 5.0 <a>HERE</a>. Its free.<br>

    It's so funny to see these two technologies itemized here. In 1999, I presented them as cutting edge, get-with-it 
    things you had to have.<Br /><br />
    Twenty five years later, these two items have completely diverged. Style Sheets (and CSS) have become a
    web standard that I use every day still. The Background music component has died and gone away in favour
    of more modern and standardized approaches.<br /><br />
    It's a good lesson - you never know what's going to stick! Too bad that IE 5.0 link is broken, I'd love to take it for a spin.

  <b>Navigation Bar</b><br>
  In case you havn't figured it out, click on the category you want on the left hand side to get the list of sections I have available for that category.  The drop down menus don't use
  java, just HTML so you can use it in older or smaller browsers.<br>

    <summary>Inclusive Design</summary>
    This is the smartest thing written on this entire website. This approach to web design, 
    building for compatibility and accessibility, is something I am constantly trying to be better at.
    It is wild to see this little nugget of wisdom coming from the same person worried about getting
    to much PORN emailed to him on <a href="../emails/email">another page</a> where he also posts all six of his emails publicly.

  I use a cool font on this Page, its called Zurich.  It is a true type font, and I don't know anyone who actually has it. So, I will put it up for download <a href="../../assets/ZEBT.zip">HERE</a>.  It is Zipped up and all you do is save it in your fonts folder under windows on your hard drive, then go to your settings under Start (windows 95+) and double click fonts.  Click file, then install new font, select tto260m_.ttf (file name) and click OK. All done. Check the site and it will look much better.</p>

    Nowadays we build sites with fallback fonts and tell the browser to install them automatically, but this
    is so helpful to put it up for download! <br /><br />
    Out of curiosity, I downloaded it and tried to install it - it worked flawlessly. But I did have to make a couple
    changes to the code on the site to recognize it. So feel free to install this nice font and see the site as it was
    originally intended!
