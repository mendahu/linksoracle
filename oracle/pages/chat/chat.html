  <!-- 
  now here's some weird stuff!

  This <APPLET> element was used to run actual Java code inside of a browser via a plugin.
  That sounds crazy by today's standard, and it rightfully went away very soon after
  it was introduced (HTML 4.01 deprecated it later in 1999).

  Looks like it would download some code (GUIClient.class) and run it in a nested execution environment.

    "Your browser does not support Java applet" appears for good reason - this technology existed for but
    a brief moment at the end of the 1990s - it was introduced and deprecated in the same HTML release!<br /><br />
    But this is what it sounded like! A live chat application right here on the site. I don't know if anyone
    ever was able to talk to someone else on it, but it theoretically could do that. It was all someone else's code,
    from a service called MultiChat.
