  I remember implementing this, believe it or not. It came from a

  This is especially strange considering all these images are not

  <P ALIGN="LEFT">     This is a guide to the main characters in the story 
  of the Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time and there are some characters 
  that aren't so important like Mido.
  <HR>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">Mido- Mido is the boss of all the Kokiri <IMG SRC="../../assets/mido.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT">Elves and will
  not let any of them leave the forest.  He is very bossy and he lives in a house
  in the Kokiri Village.<BR><BR>
  Saria- Saria is a close friend to Link.  She guards the Lost Woods and 
  the Sacred Forest Meadow and knows her way around in them very well.
  She sees the Sacred <IMG SRC="../../assets/saria.gif" ALIGN="LEFT">Forest Meadow as a great place to hang out and
  think.  She teaches Link Saria's Song which will let him speak with her
  from anywhere in Hyrule.  Later on, when Link is in his adulthood, Saria
  recieves a call from the forest requesting her help.  Naturally, she
  goes to it's aid and finds the Forest Temple is disarray.  After Link 
  defeats the Temple and saves Saria and the Forest, Saria awakens as the
  The Sage of the Forest and grants you with the Forest Medallion.<BR><BR>
  Deku Tree- The Deku Tree is the guardian of the Forest and protecter of all who 
  live in it.  At the beginning of the game, he becomes cursed by Ganondorf <IMG SRC="../../assets/Ylinkandnavi.jpg" ALIGN="RIGHT">and
  sends Navi the Fairy to find the Chosen One so that he may begin to fulfill his
  destiny and save the Deku Tree.  After Link vanquishes all the enemies inside 
  the great tree, The Deku Tree tells Link that he had no hope from the beginning.
  He briefs you of the background of your quest to save Hyrule, grants you with the Kokiri Emerald, and slowly passes away.<BR><BR>
  Princess Zelda-  As a young Princess, Zelda is aware of Ganondorf's Evil. Even though
  he has pledged his alligence to the King of Hyrule, Zelda does not trust him and his ways.
  She devotes a fair amount of time researching Ganondorf's goals and discovers that he seeks the 
  Mighty Triforce.  She also learns of the Legend of the Chosen One and hopes that he will one day 
  come.  After Link infiltrates the Castle and makes contact with Zelda, Zelda tells Link of the three
  spiritual stones <IMG SRC="../../assets/medtriforce.gif" ALIGN="LEFT">needed to open the Door of Time.  If this door is opened, one can retrieve the
  Sacred Sword and enter the Sacred Realm, where the Triforce lies.  Legend has it that when a being
  with a true heart touches the Triforce, he will be granted the power of the Gods. If his heart
  is Evil, then the Triforce will split into three separate parts: Power, Wisdom and Courage.  One 
  part will be givin to the Triforce's finder, the one that best represents him, and the others will find
  beings that they represent.  Zelda tells Link to find the three stones before Ganondorf and lock
  the Triforce away in the Sacred Realm. As Link unlocks the Door of Time, Ganondorf seizes the moment and enters
  the Sacred Realm. As he touches the Triforce, it splits with Power going to Ganondorf,
  Wisdow going to Zelda, and Courage, going to Link.<IMG SRC="../../assets/impazelda.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT"> Link takes the Sacred Sword and continues his quest.
  After Ganondorf takes Hyrule Castle, Zelda is forced to change her identity, to Sheik, and aids you in recovering
  the six medallions.  With the medallions found, Zelda awakens as the sixth sage and grants Link the
  Light Arrows.  With the power of the other five sages, Link and Zelda defeat Ganondorf and lock him in
  the Sacred Realm of Evil.<BR><BR>
  Impa- Impa is the last surviving Shiekah and the savior of Kakariko Village.  When the Shadow Beast raided the Village,
  she locked him away in the Bottom of the Well.  She now serves as Princess Zelda's servant and protecter.
  She teaches Link Zelda's Lullaby on his ocarina and escorts him out of the Castle. After Link grows up, the Shadow Beast escapes
  from the well and takes over the Shadow Temple.  After Link banishes the Beast, Impa awakens as the Sage of Shadow.<BR><BR>
  Darunia-  Darunia is the leader of the Gorons in Goron City.  When the Dodongos seize the Goron's cavern and food supply, 
  Darunia retreats to his room with the Gorons Ruby until Link comes to the rescue.  He grants Link the Goron's Bracelet <IMG SRC="Darunia.gif" ALIGN="Left">
  and asks Link to save the Gorons.  After taking the cavern, Darunia grants Link the Ruby, his second spiritual stone.
  When Link returns to Goron City as an adult, the Gorons are again in turmoil. Valvagia, a Lava Dragon, has taken the Gorons
  prissoners and imprisoned them in the Fire Temple.  Darunia aids you in defeating the temple, and after Link slays Valvagia, Darunia
  awakens as the Sage of Fire, and Grants Link with the Fire Medallion.<BR><BR>
  King Zora- King Zora is the King of the water people, the Zoras.  When Link first meets him as a child, the King requests his aid in
  finding the Princess, his daughter.  When Link returns as an adult, the Princess is gone once more, and the King grants Link with the 
  Zora's Tunic, which helps Link save the Princess once more.<BR><BR><IMG SRC="../../assets/kingzora.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT">
  Lord Jabu Jabu-  Jabu Jabu is a god to the Zoras and he lives in Zora's Fountain.  The big sea-dwelling creature took the princess
  and imprisoned her in his own belly.  After Link gives a sacrifice to Jabu Jabu, he enters his belly, saves
  the princess and recovers the third spiritual stone, Zora's Sapphire.<BR><BR>
  Princess Ruto- Princess Ruto, the daughter of King Zora was saved by Link from Lord Jabu Jabu when she was young. She
  proposed to Link in a sign for marriage as her mother had told her only to marry the one who she gave the stone to. As Ruto
  aged, she began hearing calls from the Water Templ and finally went to see what the matter was.  There, she was imprisoned by Morpha,
  a water god.  Once again, Link came to her rescue and when he defeats Morpha, she awakens as the Sage of Water, and grants Link the Medallion
  of Water.<BR><BR>

  Ingo- Ingo worked for Talon when Link was young and eventually took the ranch from Talon.  He falls under Ganondorf's influence and becomes very
  evil.  He loses a horse named Epona to Link in a bet and is forced to forget Ganondorf as Ganondorf was supposed to recieve Epona as a gift.  As Ingo
  realizes what he has done, he returns the ranch to Talon.<BR><BR>

  Sheik-  After Ganondorf raids Hyrule Castle, Impa rescues Zelda and races off into the distance.

  so that he may travel faster.<BR><BR>
  Nabooru- Nabooru is a Gerudo women that Link meets in the Spirit Temple as a child. She requests for him to find the Silver Gauntlets for

  brainwashed.  He defeats the witchs and saves Nabooru, who awakens as the Sage of Spirit.<BR><BR>

  the Door of Time, he entered the Sacred Realm and found the Triforce he had sought for years.  As he touched it split into three pieces, and he was left with one.
  After that, Ganondorf attacked Hyrule Castle with his Minions of Darkness and slayed the King. He then devoted his reign to finding
