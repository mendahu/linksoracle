  Interesting choice of using multiple table elements for this list of posts.
  I suspect it made it easier to copy and paste the one from the main page
  when it "expired" and needed to be archived here. Semantic elements were
  not a concept at this time, I don't think LOL.

  you heard right, this Hyrule at War is Beta Version 1.0, so when HAW 1.0 comes out, I will put
  the puds up for download and if you have War II, you will be able to download them and watch the war happen.
  You don't touch it, just watch.  Umm, go to my chatroom, I need people in there. If there isn't anyone there,
  wait for someone. If I can get two people in there, then there should be a constant traffic cuz people will
  stay and talk.  Well, until later, bye.</tr>

      <summary>Zap.to</summary>
      Zap.to was a redirection service you could sign up for to shorten your url. The canonical
      url above is the original hosting location, and since domain names were too difficult for me
      to figure out, this service was great. You could just type <code>zap.to/oracle</code> and get
      to the site.<br /><br />
      Hilariously all these years later, a simialr redirection service serves as the basis for one
      of the projects my students do at Web Development bootcamp.

  <P>Hey I finished the page, in a sense. All the primary info is up and
  my only job now is to add Glitches and Rumors and Pics and stuff as they
  come.  The Game is coming along excellently, we have 39 people. 
  We have way too many Hylians and I might be forces to take the form
  down and give a chance to the other armies. Join the Sheikah or the Zoras
  or the Kokiri or the Gorons!! I will put some glitches up and stuff today,
  also, I will submit some fan art by myself and put it up. Have a great
  week and talk to you tomorrow!</P>
  <P>MAY 15 99</P>
  <P>Hey I will finish Howto today. A war has broken out at Hyrule at War! Go there and check
  out the Wars Section, Headline News, Hall of Fame, and current Standings! I will also
  do some refining to the site today.</P> 
  <P>MAY 14 99</P>
  <P>Hey its my birthday today!! I will try to get the Howto section up and finished, and also
  I will go Glitch Hunting.  I will also fix the annoying Navbar small text popup thing. Um, please

  by pressing the button below, and vote for Hyrule at War!, by pressing the button at its page. 
  Thanks.</P>
  <P>MAY 12 99</P>
  <P>Today I will really work on my page, doing howto and some scripting maybe. I will also fiddle with
  some style sheets and stuff. I will probably make a Headline News Section in the Hyrule at War! Section, which is doing well. 
  The Zoras and the Sheikah Need People. I will also work out some bugs. Bye!</P>
  <P>MAY 11 99</P>
  <P>Hey We have 24 in the Game. The Zoras need some players, desperately. Please help them out. I have hired a new
  staff member today.  His name is Fido and he will be searching the net for info to put on the site. His E-mail is unknown at
  this point, because he's making one for the site. I need another staff member. If there are any good
  graphic/design artists out there who are willing to create graphics for my site for free, please e-mail me. I know you're thinking
  FREE??? You'd be surprised how rewarding it is to call something your own. So please E-mail Me!!! I will work on a bunch of stuff today including Howto and glitches, so.</P>

  <P>Hey my party was a blast. This game is becoming very popular and lots of people are beginning to join and stuff.
  I really love all the comments and I think I might put a Game Comments Section up. One thing though, we need some Kokiri!
  There is no one but Gerud, Hylian and Sheikah. The rest have little or none at all. Please help the needy and join the lesser armies!
  I will probably work on the Howto today and maybe that game comment section. Well c'ya later!</P>
  <P>MAY 06 99</P>
  <P>Hey the game worked out well so far. The Gerudos are fairly popular as I thought they'd be.
  Please join it by clicking <A HREF="../war/war.html">Hyrule at War!</A> <--there or at the bottom of the navbar. 
  We need some Kokiri, Gorons, Sheikah, Zoras and some Hylians, mostly. Today I will work on a little bit of
  the Howto section but not much. I have to prepare for my Party, tomorrow. I might not update tomorrow except
  for the game stuff. Bye!</P>

      Total aside, but I'm pretty sure this "Party" in question here was my 14th birthday, and it might
      have been my very first "boy-girl" party as we called them back then, where you had the guts to 
      invite the girls in your class to your birthday instead of just all your stinky boy buds. Big day

  Today is My one month Anniversary and I am as you read this, working on the game! It will be so cool!
  Also, I might get to doin some Howto stuff and Maybe make the glitches section. I did finish the Gold Skulltulas
  last night and I think they're all there. One last thing, I got a redirection Service membership so you don't 
  have to type the big long address anymore. Now it is just <A HREF="http://zap.to/oracle/">zap.to/oracle</A> so...Until Tomorrow!</P>
  <P>MAY 04 99<BR><BR>
  Tomorrow's the big day, Our one month anniversary. And, to celebrate, I'm releasing "Hyrule at War!", my online Zelda
  Game which I have been told by my Fellow companions, has a strange ressemblance to the board game, "Risk". However,
  It will still be a hit, as long as you guys, the fans, tell a lot of people about it! Please do this! I love publicity,
  hell, I couldn't get enough of it!!!!! Anyway, I finished the Walkthroughs Section and part of the Gold Skulltulas Appendix
  which I hope to finid=sh today, along with the rest of the Howto section. I got a few Quiz Results and I wil announce that
  I will not change it until someone aces it!!! Well, until then!!!!!</P>
  <P>MAY 03 99</P>
  Hey, with the approach of our 1 Month Anniversary, I will release "Hyrule at War", the interactive online game where you
  enter your name and create a character of one of Six different races throughout Hyrule and they will join somewhat of an 
  "Army", or a list of characters from the same race. After about a month, I will simulate a war between an undetermined amount
  of the races, all of this is random, of course. Certain characters will die, some will live, others will recieve honorary
  mention and the Medal of Valor, Promoting them to the next rank. Over time, your characters can also gain rank, simply by 
  surviving. Check it out on May 05, 1999! Today I will attempt to finish the walkthroughs, I got up to the Hookshot last night.
  Also, I will put some Howto stuff up. Teaser for today: Link's Oracle, <I>en francais?</I></P>
  <P>MAY 02 99<BR>
  Hey, the image gallery has a whole new look with thumbnails. It loads
  way faster.  I WILL get the walkthroughs up and a bit finished, finally!
  Please vote for me in the Top 100 Zelda Sites Below!!! Bye for now!</P>
  <P>MAY 01 99<BR><BR>
  Hey, Last night I got the screenshots up and finally complete. I also worked out a lot of bugs and glitches.
  Today I will put a boss section up and add a bunch of images to the Image Gallery that I got. I think I'm gonna make thumbnails
  for that page, its getting big. I will also try to put that game up. It will take a lot of work. C'ya!</P>

  Finally, I'm back. My dad got all upset about the churnoble virus thats floating around and did
  all this file backing up and virus scans and stuff so I couldn't get on. I'm back now and in full force. I think the break
  was good for me. This week really sucked for me, I lost about 90% of my hits. Anyway, I will be putting an editorial section up and
  try to get that interactive game i've been teasing you about working. Got a players guide today. My info will be upgraded. Well until then! <I>My e-mail does work. Thanks for all the 
  feedback and keep it coming!</I></P>

  Happy Secrataries Day! I got some more of the screenshots page up and applied for a bunch of awards. Hopefully I'll get them. I thought more
  about the interactive game thing and I've decided that if I can get help, I will do it. If you wish to help, you must have at least passed the game of Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time,
  you must own your own Zelda 64 page, you must put a banner link to me on that page, you must have a valid E-Mail address, and you must be available on the Internet alot. If you're interested
  please go to the e-mail section and send me a line. If you agree, I'll give you the big details and stuff. It would really help if I could get someone of a graphic designer to, Because I could use the help.
  I will put up a comment Section today to house the GOOD comments that I get. Any bad ones I will try to fix. I might also get to a music section. VOTE FOR ME!</P>

  Internet Explorer. Oh Well, that's all, BYE!<BR><BR>
  APR 18 99<BR><BR>
  Hey I'm #6 on the top 100 Zelda Sites!!! Hurray!!!! Anyway, I got a bunch of screenshots yesterday and a shit load of midi files. I might put them up if I get to it but I'm busy today.

  I got the enemies section up and running but there are a lot of glitches I got to get out. I'll
  work on that today and start my Links section.  I will try to become a Biggoron's Workshop Affilate but its pretty hard. Also, if I can, I'll start the glitches section.
  One last thing, I found another site called the Zelda Zone and its number 2 on the top 50 Zelda Sites. I think I'll have to change my name...how about, Link's Oracle?? COOL!!
  That's all for now.<BR><BR>

  APR 09 99<BR><BR>
  I didn't manage to get the Screenshots Gallery up but I did get the noframes tag workin so People without a frames compatible browser can see my page. Now I'm gonna build the enemies section as soon as I find a 
  list in alphabetical order. My intenet connection is non-existant today so I'm gonna start uploading the pages tomorrow. One last thing, I gotta figure out how to create an in-page link so its easier for you to get to the items/enemies/characters that you want to go see faster.<BR><BR>

  Yesterday I finished the Image Gallery, FAQ, Rumors section, and E-Mail section.  Today I'm gonna make that no frames page and maybe go find some screenshots. Also, I think I'll start on the enemies section.<BR><BR>

  I finished Items and Characters last night and today I'm going to add a rumors section, a glitches section, a picture gallery, and an FAQ.  I will probably only 
  finish my rumors section, seeing as I only have my own rumors, the E-Mail page, the Picture Gallery and maybe the FAQ.  If you have any please send them in @ <U>Links_Oracle@hotmail.com</U> or click 
  <A HREF="mailto:Links_Oracle@hotmail.com">HERE</A>. Oh yeah, I will be making an alternate page for the poor saps without
  frames-compatible browsers so they're not totally out of luck. One last thing.  If anyone out there has a good font, please send it to me!!</P>

  <P ALIGN="LEFT">     Got the frames up and running and started the Items section which will include all items
  you can get from the game from weapons to masks to bottles, etc.  Navi my navbar is working (finally after all night reading my HTML bible!!)
  So for now I will work on Items and maybe start on the Character Guide section.</P>
  <P>APR 05 99</P>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">     Page is made. Basic.  No links yet, no images, 
  just up.  Got a title and an e-mail.  I'm writing this whole damn page in Notepad.  Gotta
  refresh on my HTML.  What about frames.......??  HUH, don't even 
  want to think about that, I'll just do it, sorry all you poor lamerz 
  without frames compatible browsers.  I don't know why you complain. 
  Browsers are free!!!  So, we got frames, title (gotta finish my logo!), and e-mail.
  My links are there, but not active, heh, heh.  I downloaded some pics of weapons, enemies and stuff
  and I will put them on the pages they belong on when they are up. Got a couple of pictures up now too.</P>
