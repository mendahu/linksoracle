  This level is nasty.  So, after 2 hours of mapping it out, I've found 
  a way to get to the Lens of Truth very quickly.  There are a bunch of 
  treasures scattered in this level but they are almost all WORTHLESS!  
  Most of them are a single Deku nut.  I'm going to tell you how to get 
  the Lens of Truth, a gold rupee (worth 200 rupees), and finally the 3 
  gold skulltula's that are here (I've never mentioned most of the gold 
  skulltulas before but explaining them here instead of making you 
  explore this whole confusing level to get them is just easier.)  Crawl 
  through the hole and climb down the ladder.  Kill the skulltula then 
  walk straight forward right through the wall in front of you (yes, you 
  heard right, this level has walls you can walk through, invisible 
  floors, etc.).  Now you're in the main well room.  Watch out for the 
  giant green flaming skull flying around and just keep running straight 
  forward through another wall.  Now ignore everything in this room but 
  watch out, there's a small invisible pit right in the center of the 
  room where all that blood is.  Move around the pit and keep moving 
  forward to the opposite wall and, again, walk through it.  Now stand 
  on the Triforce symbol in front of you and play Zelda's Lullaby.  The 
  water will drain out.<BR><BR> 
  
  Now turn around and go back through the wall, avoid the pit, through 
  the next wall, and you're back where you started, except now there's a 
  big pit in front of you.  Fall down it and crawl through the hole 
  that's down there.  Kill the skulltula, climb up the vines and go 
  through the door to the Bottom of the Well boss.  This guy is scary 
  but easy.  It's basically a swing-your-sword-wildly-at-anything-that-
  moves affair.  You can kill the hands coming out of the ground.  
  If they grab you just wildly mash your buttons until they let go and 
  keep slashing at them.  You don't need to kill the hands, just the 
  weird thing walking around trying to bite you.  Once it's dead, a 
  treasure box will appear containing the Lens of Truth.  Use the lens 
  of truth in this room and you'll find an invisible treasure box.  
  Open it for 200 rupees.  Now if you wish, you can just leave now by 
  playing the Prelude of Light and go on to the next section.  
  Otherwise, read on for how to get the 3 gold skulltulas in this 
  level.<BR><BR> 
  
  Get out of the pit.  Now go down the left path a little bit and if you 
  use your lens you'll see a small alcove in the right hand wall.  Go in 
  and retrieve the key that's there.  Now leave the alcove and go left 
  (back toward the starting point).  Keep going and you'll hit a left 
  turn.  Turn and use your lens and you'll see another alcove containing 
  another key.  Now leave the alcove and continue down the corridor.  
  A little ways more and you'll see a cage with a Shield-eater in it.  
  Directly across from it is a wall you can walk through.  Go through 
  it and walk straight across the room (avoid the pit in the middle!  
  You can see it with your lens now).  Go through the opposite wall and 
  down the small corridor.  You'll see a grate ahead of you.  Fall down 
  the pit you come to, walk under the grate, and climb up the vines on 
  the opposite side and go through the door.<BR><BR> 
  
  Now in this next room is a mummy.  Use your Song of the Sun to stun 
  it and kill it with your sword.  Now take out a Deku stick and light 
  it with the torch but DO NOT LIGHT ANY TORCHES with it yet.  All these 
  torches open the coffin next to them and will release more enemies.  
  You need to light a specific torch.  It's the torch in the corner 
  furthest from the door and to the left when looking from the door.  
  Light the torch and the coffin will open letting out two bats.  Kill 
  the bats and inside the coffin is the third and final small key.  If 
  the bats burned away your Deku shield don't worry you can get another 
  free one on the way to the third spider.  Now head out of this room, 
  fall down the pit and climb up the other side, and go straight through 
  the wall in front of you.  Look left and there's a locked door.  Go 
  through and kill the plant, watch out for the pots, they attack you, 
  and there's spider number 1.<BR><BR> 
  
  Leave and turn left, avoid the pit, and there's another locked door on 
  the other side of the room.  In here is a bunch of bats and a big pit 
  in the middle.  Don't worry, there's an invisible floor.  Just walk 
  around the outside of the pit and you won't fall in.  The spider is in 
  the opposite corner of the room from where you entered.  Now leave the 
  room, turn left immediately and walk through the wall.  Turn left 
  again and continue down this corridor.  You'll see some kind of face 
  picture on the wall at the end of the corridor.  Right underneath it 
  is a pit so don't fall down it.  Now turn right at the end of the 
  corridor and you'll be at a dead end with a hole to crawl through.  
  Crawl through and go through the locked door.  Before moving into 
  this room use your lens to see all the pits spread all over the 
  place.  Kill the bats and kill the laser shooting thing in the middle 
  of the room by throwing a bomb at it.  The chest in this room contains 
  a replacement Deku shield if you lost yours.  Go through the door and 
  you'll be in the cage with the Shield-eater.  Avoid it when it tries 
  to suck you into it and hit it with your boomerang or sword when it 
  stops.  Kill the third and final gold skulltula in this room.  Now use 
  your Ocarina and play the Prelude of Light to warp out of this 
  hellhole and end up back in the Temple of Time.  Go into the Master S
  word room and replace the Master Sword to warp to the future and 
  continue your main quest.  Pat yourself on the back for getting 3 
  well-earned skulltulas and the Lens of Truth.
