        I remember building the background image for this. I had
        opened up Microsoft Paint and one pixel at a time made a descending
        green gradient that faded to black. Then I copied and pasted the line
        a bunch of time to vertically stack them and produce the whole image.

        I apparently didn't know how to use margins or even just empty 
        <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> elements. Instead, these navspace.gif 
        files were cutouts from the background, used as "transparent" 
        spacers that indented the text. What an incredible 
        amount of work that would be solved today with some margin.

        I speak French and I thought at the time it would be a fun experiment to create a French version of the 
        site that you could switch to. There wasn't any fancy tech - I think I literally just copied and pasted the
        entire site to another account and manually changed all the text. I suspect I was not good at keeping up with 
        changes over time and it was probably behind on content as compared to the original site.<br /><br />
        Unfortunately that other account appears to be gone. I have no idea what logic Tripod would have used to
        determine that the original English site should be maintained for 25 years while the French one should go.
        Sounds like the kind of discrimination my French-Canadian compatriots have been shouting about all this time!
