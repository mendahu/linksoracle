  Frames were a big deal back then. It felt like magic, 
  you could create a layout on the page and have indepenently 
  operating panels with their own HTML. You just assigned them names
  and then pointed your links to target them as needed.

  <!-- 
  Much like today's JavaScript warnings, there was this NOFRAMES 
  tag to fallback for browsers that didn't yet support Frames, 
  a weakness I apparently was very judgemental about, you dutz.
  And yet, I provided a fallback...what was it, Jake? Did you care
  about inclusive design or not??
