  <P>Welcome to Hyrule at War! My online game which has been commented as very similar to Risk.
  Here you can join armies, fight wars and gain honorary mention and ranks!
  Join any of 6 races and live the simulation!</P>

    <summary>Hyrule at War</summary>
    This was probably my crowning achievement on this site. It was a "game" that users could sign up for
    by choosing a side. Every day, I would go through the registrations and add them to a page
    which tracked who was on each team. Then I would run a "simulation" for what would happen that day.<br/><br/>
    The "simulation" was nothing more than me assigning some probabilities to different events and then 
    rolling dice to see what happened. Sometimes the teams would go to war and I'd roll more dice
    to determine outcomes, etc. Sometimes players would die and they would have to restart. Or they'd survive
    and gain experience.<br /><br />
    There wasn't any strategy to it, you just hopped on and enjoyed the ride. I think at one point I had 
    come up with a way to use the Warcraft II video game on my computer to be the simulator, assigning 
    different team makeups to units in that game. But I don't remember much of this anymore.<br /><br />
    It was very popular with my friends and I think there were something like 100+ people registered to "play".
    There were even some copycats (see the links to Other Games).
