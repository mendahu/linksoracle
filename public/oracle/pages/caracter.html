  <P ALIGN="LEFT">     This is a guide to the main characters in the story 
  of the Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time and there are some characters 
  that aren't so important like Mido.
  <HR>
  <P ALIGN="LEFT">Mido- Mido is the boss of all the Kokiri <IMG SRC="mido.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT">Elves and will
  not let any of them leave the forest.  He is very bossy and he lives in a house
  in the Kokiri Village.<BR><BR>
  Saria- Saria is a close friend to Link.  She guards the Lost Woods and 
  the Sacred Forest Meadow and knows her way around in them very well.
  She sees the Sacred <IMG SRC="saria.gif" ALIGN="LEFT">Forest Meadow as a great place to hang out and
  think.  She teaches Link Saria's Song which will let him speak with her
  from anywhere in Hyrule.  Later on, when Link is in his adulthood, Saria
  recieves a call from the forest requesting her help.  Naturally, she
  goes to it's aid and finds the Forest Temple is disarray.  After Link 
  defeats the Temple and saves Saria and the Forest, Saria awakens as the
  The Sage of the Forest and grants you with the Forest Medallion.<BR><BR>
  Deku Tree- The Deku Tree is the guardian of the Forest and protecter of all who 
  live in it.  At the beginning of the game, he becomes cursed by Ganondorf <IMG SRC="Ylinkandnavi.jpg" ALIGN="RIGHT">and
  sends Navi the Fairy to find the Chosen One so that he may begin to fulfill his
  destiny and save the Deku Tree.  After Link vanquishes all the enemies inside 
  the great tree, The Deku Tree tells Link that he had no hope from the beginning.
  He briefs you of the background of your quest to save Hyrule, grants you with the Kokiri Emerald, and slowly passes away.<BR><BR>
  Princess Zelda-  As a young Princess, Zelda is aware of Ganondorf's Evil. Even though
  he has pledged his alligence to the King of Hyrule, Zelda does not trust him and his ways.
  She devotes a fair amount of time researching Ganondorf's goals and discovers that he seeks the 
  Mighty Triforce.  She also learns of the Legend of the Chosen One and hopes that he will one day 
  come.  After Link infiltrates the Castle and makes contact with Zelda, Zelda tells Link of the three
  spiritual stones <IMG SRC="medtriforce.gif" ALIGN="LEFT">needed to open the Door of Time.  If this door is opened, one can retrieve the
  Sacred Sword and enter the Sacred Realm, where the Triforce lies.  Legend has it that when a being
  with a true heart touches the Triforce, he will be granted the power of the Gods. If his heart
  is Evil, then the Triforce will split into three separate parts: Power, Wisdom and Courage.  One 
  part will be givin to the Triforce's finder, the one that best represents him, and the others will find
  beings that they represent.  Zelda tells Link to find the three stones before Ganondorf and lock
  the Triforce away in the Sacred Realm. As Link unlocks the Door of Time, Ganondorf seizes the moment and enters
  the Sacred Realm. As he touches the Triforce, it splits with Power going to Ganondorf,
  Wisdow going to Zelda, and Courage, going to Link.<IMG SRC="impazelda.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT"> Link takes the Sacred Sword and continues his quest.
  After Ganondorf takes Hyrule Castle, Zelda is forced to change her identity, to Sheik, and aids you in recovering
  the six medallions.  With the medallions found, Zelda awakens as the sixth sage and grants Link the
  Light Arrows.  With the power of the other five sages, Link and Zelda defeat Ganondorf and lock him in
  the Sacred Realm of Evil.<BR><BR>
  Impa- Impa is the last surviving Shiekah and the savior of Kakariko Village.  When the Shadow Beast raided the Village,
  she locked him away in the Bottom of the Well.  She now serves as Princess Zelda's servant and protecter.
  She teaches Link Zelda's Lullaby on his ocarina and escorts him out of the Castle. After Link grows up, the Shadow Beast escapes
  from the well and takes over the Shadow Temple.  After Link banishes the Beast, Impa awakens as the Sage of Shadow.<BR><BR>

  Darunia retreats to his room with the Gorons Ruby until Link comes to the rescue.  He grants Link the Goron's Bracelet <IMG SRC="Darunia.gif" ALIGN="Left">
  and asks Link to save the Gorons.  After taking the cavern, Darunia grants Link the Ruby, his second spiritual stone.
