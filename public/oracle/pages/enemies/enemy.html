  <IMG SRC="../../assets/floormaster.jpg" ALIGN="LEFT">Floor Master- These nasty little sons of bitches are a pain.
    Some of these guys will split into 3 small hands that you have to kill right away or they

    when you attack at the wrong time, it will block you.  Wait til he lets his guard down to slice you and do a Z-targeted jump attack. If you roll under
    his jump attack and hit his back, you'll do more damage. Try using bombs or a spin attack. These guys are good practice.<BR><BR>
