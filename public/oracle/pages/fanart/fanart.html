  I remember implementing this, believe it or not. It came from a
  very weird place - I didn't want people stealing the images off 
  the site, so this would trigger an alert if you tried to right-click

  This is especially strange considering all these images are not
  mine and were just stolen from other sites LOL. And as you can
  see below, so was the script to prevent it!

      I called this page Fan Art but it really ended up being a Silvestris tribute page. Silvestris
      was a talented artist who made some really great drawings of this game.
      I think she was around my age and I remember her being very gracious about sharing her work and
      letting me display it.<br /><br />
      The links here were broken when I found them, so out of curiosity I went searching for her. I'm delighted
      to learn she pursued illustration and now runs <a href="https://silvystrand.se">her own company</a> in Sweden.<br /><br />
      I was able to find most of these images hosted around the web and have made copies here to preserve the connections.
