    <summary>Incorrect Title</summary>
    Looks like I was a victim of copying and pasting code from one page to another
    in order to avoid retyping boilerplate. This title <em>should</em> be "Battle Moves" 
    or something but it is stolen from <a href="youngtrade.html">The trading sequence file</a>.
    <br /><br />Friends don't let friends copy code, folks.
