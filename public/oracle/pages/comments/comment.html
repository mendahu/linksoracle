    Evidence that I did at one point have forms on this site! They were such a pain to figure out without
    running a server to handle them.<br /><br />
    I recognize a lot of my friends' names and handles down here, they were so supportive ❤️

  Hey, your site is the best! I read your enemy page and you said Dinalfos only appear in Ganon's Castle. Well they also appear in Gerudo Training Ground.<BR><BR>

    At the time of this annotation, Charmander's site appears to still be up and is
    a similar story to mine - barely usable with all the injected ads from Angelfire, 
    which was another hosting provider simialr to Tripod or Geocities at the time.
    I'll leave the link up for now!
