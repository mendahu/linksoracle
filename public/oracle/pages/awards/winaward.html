    This was another weird, fun and maybe a little bit self-congratulatory aspect
    of the web culture at this time. All of us making these kinds of sites would produce
    and "award" with a banner and give it to other sites of the same genre. Often, we'd 
    get one back. It was a primitive form of recommendations, a webring without the tech.<br /><br />
    Looks like the three awardees' sites I picked have all been taken down, but I'll 
    leave their names up for posterity.
