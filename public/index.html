      <h1>Going back in time</h1>
      <p>
        Many years ago at the end of the last millenium, 14-year-old me turned
        an obsession with famed Nintendo 64 game
        <cite
          ><a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Ocarina_of_Time"
            >The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a
          ></cite
        >
        into his very first website, called <cite>Link's Oracle</cite>. Through
        some miraculous stroke of luck, the website survived decades of
        technology changes and corporate buyouts and remains hosted at its
        <a href="https://ganon4.tripod.com/oracle.html">original location</a> on
        Tripod. I've rehosted it here for archival purposes, and it serves now
        as a reflection of my past self, a look at the internet as it once was,
        and, well, a laugh.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the full experience, try opening the site in a browser with 640
        pixels of width, which I think is how high-tech my sick 17 inch CRT
        monitor was back then.

        was a formative video game for me would be an understatement. I was
        thirteen years old when it came out in November of 1998, and twenty-five
        years later I still consider it a masterpiece in storytelling, game
        design and world-building. With a bunch of extra time on my hands, I
        wanted to do more than just play it.
      </p>
      <p>
        My Dad was into computers at that time, and in early 1999 in our
        computer room (yes, we had a computer room), I found a copy of this
        book:
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img
          src="./assets/using_html32.jpg"
          alt="The book cover of Using HTML Version 3.2: Special Edition, with a stock photo of a chain and a bright label at the top saying Bestseller! Over 175,000 copies sold!"
          width="312"
          height="385"
        />
        <figcaption>

        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        It was a monster, probably over a thousand pages, something like 8-10 cm
        thick. I poured over it, learning everything I could about using
        <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> to build websites.
        It became my bible in 1999. I kept it next to my bed to read at night.
        It was so incredible to me that you could just type codes into a text
        document and that was about all you needed to make something that would
        go on the real internet.
      </p>
      <p>So I got to work.</p>
      <h2>Building Link's Oracle</h2>
      <p>
        As a professional web developer today, I can't help but laugh thinking
        back to my "work flows" in 1999. The internet was so simple back then. I
        opened up <cite>Notepad.exe</cite> on the family Windows 95 machine (or
        maybe it was Windows 98 - it's unclear if and when we upgraded!) and
        just started typing.
      </p>
      <p>
        The host I had chosen at the time (Tripod) had a simple upload screen on
        your account, a glorified way to copy the files in your hard drive to
        your hosted account. And just like that, I could access it via the web
        and share it with my friends. There wasn't a local development
        environment, there wasn't a testing process, you just stuck it online
        and refreshed your browser until you were happy. Doin' it live.
      </p>
      <p>
        I remember experimenting with JavaScript. It was much more opaque to me
        than HTML was. Most of what I did was copy and pasting pre-made scripts
        from others on the web, some of which you can still see in the codebase
        today. CSS was in its infancy at this time and not well-supported, so
        much of the "styling" I did is encoded right there in the HTML
        attributes using some great elements like <code>&lt;FONT&gt;</code> and
        <code>&lt;CENTER&gt;</code>. The early web did not have great separation
        of concerns.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are a lot of gems in the code, and as you browse the site you can
        check for my personal annotations, added today, with more insights into
        what I might have been thinking.
      </p>
      <h2>Hibernation</h2>
      <p>
        In the summer of 1999 I moved on to whatever else I was interested in at
        the time (<cite>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater</cite>? Playing in a rock roll
        band? Girls??), but apparently never bothered actually shutting anything
        down online. The site just kept on keeping on.
      </p>
      <p>
        At various points in my life I would remember it and check up on it, and
        mirculously find it still sitting there on the web. As time passed, the
        internet changed around it, transforming from the document-rich weird
        place of scattered hyperlinks to the massive consumerism machine it is
        today. Tripod began injecting ads into the site, so much so that today
        it's virtually unusable. Real fact: I had to disable JavaScript on this
        site while I had it open so as to be able to click links and also to
        prevent my computer from overheating because it was doing some kind of
        infinite loop.
      </p>
      <p>
        I lost track of the account information to log in, long-forgotten
        passwords who could only be reset through long-forgotten email accounts
        on providers that had been rebranded or bought out over and over again.
        But Tripod kept it up.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, twenty five years later, I decided to put in a little effort
        and recover it. For posterity.
      </p>
      <h2>Recovery</h2>
      <p>
        The first thing I had to do was retrieve the markup files. Thankfully,
        because there was no build stage in a simple
        <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> tree like this, just
        visiting the site would return the entire file, meaning I could
        "download" the content from my lost account. So, one by one, I visited
        each page and copied the contents of the result to a new repository. I
        did the same with all the referenced media files, too.
      </p>
      <p>
        Could I have automated this? Sure. Did I? No. You should never automate
        something you'll only do once. Plus, this is how 13-year-old me would
        have done it anyway, and there's something to be said about honouring
        your past.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tripod injected all kinds of weird javascript into each file, which I
        had to strip out manually. I also removed any referenced to others'
        email addresses (which apprently I used to just post online?) and last
        names.
      </p>
      <p>
        After preserving this "source code" in an archive file, I went to work
        cleaning it up for modern viewing. My goal was to preserve the source
        code as much as possible while enhancing the usability, leaving in "bad"
        code but changing things like indentation and folder structure to make
        browsing it a little more sane.
      </p>
      <p>
        Along the way, I began annotating what I discovered. If you're a
        developer, you can check the source code itself for code comments. If
        you're just browsing it, look out for the little annotation icon, which
        you can click to learn more.
