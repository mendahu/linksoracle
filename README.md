# Link's Oracle

Many years ago at the end of the last millenium, 13-year-old me turned an obsession with famed Nintendo 64 game [The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Ocarina_of_Time) into his very first website, called Link's Oracle. Through some miraculous stroke of luck, the website survived decades of technology changes and corporate buyouts and remains hosted at its [original location](https://ganon4.tripod.com/oracle.html) on Tripod.

Over a weekend, I decided to rescue the website and rehost it, cleaned up for easy browsing and with some annotations from present me, commenting on past me's choices. It serves now as a reflection of my past self, a look at the internet as it once was, and, well, a laugh.

[Start here](https://linksoracle.com) for the whole story.

[The Original Location](https://ganon4.tripod.com/oracle.html) - No guarantees how long this will last. Browse at your own risk. Tripod is thirsty for your money and seem to think the best way to get it is with _moar ads_.

## Original Source Code

The original source code, as best as I was able to recover it, is in `/original` compressed into a ZIP file.

## Cleaned up site

The cleaned up site is available in `/oracle` (and via [https://linksoracle.com/oracle/oracle.html](https://linksoracle.com/oracle/oracle.html))
